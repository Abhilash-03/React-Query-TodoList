# About Project

This project is based on React-Query in which using react-query I've built the Todo-list app. It's a react-query learning project in which I've learned about react-query and how it works.
- I've used json-server to store my data (data/db.json).
- In this project, I've performed CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations.
- To fetch data I've used Axios.
